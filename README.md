# Rusty's Repairs Web Client
Building further on the Rusty's Repairs university project (also on GitHub) to include a client based system with which the workers (and possibly customers) can interact. 

This project focuses on the following systems:
- Customers can create, read, update and delete their accounts.
- Customers can create, review, update and cancel a booking made for a car repair.
- The Garage Manager can approve, view, update and cancel booking slots made by customers.
